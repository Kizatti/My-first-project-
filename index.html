        Family is a group of people united by the ties of marriage, blood, or adoption,
        constituting a single household and interacting with each other in their respective social positions, 
        usually those of spouses, parents, children, siblings and cousins.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first love you ever know often comes from your parents and your immediate family members. This unconditional
         love seeks nothing in return. 
        Those loving times you remember cuddling with your parents, playing ball with your brother in the backyard, 
        or getting pampered by your siblings whenever you're down, during your ups and down, those moments aren't 
        just cherished memories.
        The memories we make with our family is everything.
    </p>
    <p>The most important thing in the world is family and love.
        Having a place to go is a home, Having someone to love is a family, Having both is a blessing.
        I can really say I'm blessed to have this set of people as my FAMILY.
