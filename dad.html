            <p>Dads play a vital role in the family unit. They provide a sense of security, stability, and support. 
                They are often the breadwinners and role models for their children. They teach their kids about responsibility, 
                hard work, and how to be a good person.
                They are also there to offer a listening ear, a shoulder to cry on, and a helping hand when needed. 
                Dads play an important role in their children's lives and are an irreplaceable part of the family.</p>
            <p>My father gave me the greatest gift anyone could give another person, he believed in me. When my father didnâ€™t have my hand, he had my back.
             He was there when I didn't understand, he was there when I was wrong, he was there when I cried, he was there when I lied. 
             For some reason my dad was always there, when I needed him the most. His love was never-ending.</p>
            <p>Now that I'm an adult, I can say that you were right about almost every thing. I'm so lucky to have a role model like you in my life, Love you Dad</p>
