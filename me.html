			<p><B>KAYBEE</B> Family is a group of people united by the ties of marriage, blood, or adoption, 
                constituting a single household and interacting with each other in their respective social positions, 
                usually those of spouses, parents, children, siblings and cousins.</p>
            <p>The first love you ever know often comes from your parents and your immediate family members. This unconditional love seeks nothing in return. 
                Those loving times you remember cuddling with your parents, playing ball with your brother in the backyard, 
                or getting pampered by your siblings whenever you're down, during your ups and down, those moments arenâ€™t just cherished memories.
                "The memories we make with our family is everything."</p>
